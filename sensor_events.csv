AcUninstallConfirmation,"This event is generated when a Falcon sensor is uninstalled from a host. Important: The Falcon sensor stores events locally in a cache, which enables you to maintain data integrity even if connection to the cloud is interrupted. The cache holds a maximum of 20,000 events and sends them after a host re-establishes a connection with the cloud. However, if you reboot, the cache is lost. This means that if you uninstall a sensor off network and reboot, the cache storing those events is lost, including any AcUninstallConfirmation events.","Windows, macOS, Linux"

For more information, see ProcessRollup2Stats. This event (often called ""PR2"" for short) is generated for a process that is running or has finished running on a host and contains information about that process. For every ProcessRollup2 event, there is a corresponding event that is generated when a process completes. The name of this event is EndOfProcess for Windows and Mac and TerminateProcess for Linux. Important: This event is generated on Windows, Mac, and Linux sensors. However, because of the way Mac and Linux manage processes at the kernel level, the Falcon sensors for these platforms are configured to send ProcessRollup2information in a second event called ProcessRollup2Stats. For more information, see ProcessRollup2Stats. Understanding TargetProcessId Every ProcessRollup2 event contains a field called TargetProcessId. This ID is generated internally by the sensor, and will be unique for every instance of a process. For example, if you run cmd.exe twice, you will see two different ProcessRollup2 events with two unique values for TargetProcessId. This ID should not be confused with the host operating system PID for the process, which will be a different value. Processes often generate multiple, if not dozens of related events. For example, opening a browser or running an executable can generate network connectivity events, temporary file write events, DNS request events, etc. We therefore need a way to understand the parent-child relationship between processes and the events they generate. Understanding ContextProcessId Every event that is generated by a ProcessRollup2 contains a data field called ContextProcessId. The ContextProcessId will match the TargetProcessId of its parent ProcessRollup2 event. In the example below, the ContextProcessId values indicate that each of the events are children of the parent ProcessRollup2events. By searching for events that have matching values for ContextProcessId and TargetProcessId, you can see a list of all events that were generated as a result of a ProcessRollup2 event. Understanding ParentProcessId As previously mentioned, every process that executes on a host has a corresponding ProcessRollup2 event. This means that when a process spawns another process, a brand new ProcessRollup2 event will be generated for that new ProcessRollup2event. This new event will contain a field called ParentProcessId. The ParentProcessId of the child PR2 will match the TargetProcessId of the parent PR2, as shown below : By searching for events that have matching values for ParentProcessId and TargetProcessId, you can determine the parent-child relationship of multiple ProcessRollup2 events. This event (often called ""PR2"" for short) is generated for a process that is running or has finished running on a host and contains information about that process. For every ProcessRollup2 event, there is a corresponding event that is generated when a process completes. The name of this event is EndOfProcess for Windows and Mac and TerminateProcess for Linux.
